### Introduction
In "Make Time," Knapp and Zeratsky challenge the notion that productivity is the ultimate goal. Instead, they advocate for intentional time management to prioritize meaningful activities, regain control over one's schedule, and enhance overall well-being.

### Main Ideas
#### Idea 1: Highlight
Choose a single activity or task that you want to be the focus of your day. This Highlight should be something that brings you satisfaction or moves you closer to your goals. By focusing on one main thing, you ensure that your day feels productive and fulfilling.

Eliminate or minimize distractions to concentrate fully on your Highlight. This involves creating a distraction-free environment, employing tools and techniques like time-blocking, and being mindful of your habits around technology and interruptions.

#### Idea 3: Energize
Your physical well-being plays a crucial role in your ability to stay focused and productive. The authors suggest practices such as regular exercise, healthy eating, adequate sleep, and mindful breaks to keep your energy levels high throughout the day.

#### Idea 4: Reflect
At the end of each day, take a moment to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. This reflection helps you understand which strategies are effective and which need adjustment. It’s a continuous process of learning and improving your time management approach.
